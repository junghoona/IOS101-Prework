# Prework - *Background Color*

Submitted by: John An

**Background Color** is an app with simple UI design made up of three Labels and one Button. The Labels display the user's name, user's university name, and the user's current/aspirational job. The Button is labeled 'Click Here' and when selected, changes the background color of the app to a random color. The purpose of this app is to experiment with some UI elements, and connecting user gesture on the UI to logic that triggers IBAction.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

# Example App: Instagram
  - Simple, minimalist UI design   
  - Account privacy option

# Example App: Spotify
    - Liking songs adds songs to the Liked Songs playlist
    - Filtering songs by genre
    - Recently Played carousel component lists recent audio

# Example App: Google Maps
    - Minimizing or maximizing the Location info
    - Minimizing the app doesn't terminate GPS 

I would like to build an app that, in essence, simplifies the process of searching for a new home. The app would allow users (landlords, property owners, real estate agents, tenants) to share either rental property, or housing available for purchase. On the other hand, users searching for a new home can view the list of available housing, access housing information, and would be able to contact other users to schedule house visits and/or begin negotiations.

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

    - Using different elements to improve the aesthetics of the app UI design 
    - Adding additional elements beyond the requirement scope
